What is DeepGraph
*****************

DeepGraph is an open source `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ implementation
of a new network representation introduced
`here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00971>`_. Its purpose is to facilitate any
kind of
`data analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis>`_ by
interpreting data in terms of
`network theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory>`_.

The basis of this software package is `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, a
fast and flexible data analysis tool for the Python programming language.
Utilizing one of its primary data structures, the
`DataFrame <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_,
we represent objects (i.e. the nodes of a network) by one DataFrame, and their
pairwise relations (i.e. the edges of a network) by another DataFrame.

One of the main features of DeepGraph is an efficient and scalable creation of
edges. Given a set of nodes in the form of a DataFrame (or an on disc
`HDFStore <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#hdf5-pytables>`_),
DeepGraph's :py:meth:`core class <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph>` provides
:ref:`methods <creating_edges>` to iteratively compute pairwise relations
between the nodes (e.g. similarity/distance measures) using arbitrary, user-defined
functions on the nodes' features. These methods provide arguments to
parallelize the computation and control memory consumption, making them
suitable for very large data-sets and adjustable to whatever hardware you have
at hand (from netbooks to cluster architectures).

Furthermore, once a graph is constructed, DeepGraph allows you to partition its
:py:meth:`nodes <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph.partition_nodes>`,
:py:meth:`edges <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph.partition_edges>` or the entire
:py:meth:`graph <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph.partition_graph>` by the
graph's properties and labels, enabling the aggregation, computation and
allocation of information on and between arbitrary *groups* of nodes.

DeepGraph is not meant to replace or compete with already existing Python
network libraries, such as `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ or
`graph\_tool <https://graph-tool.skewed.de/>`_, but rather to combine and
extend their capabilities with the merits of Pandas. For that matter, the core
class of DeepGraph provides :ref:`interfacing methods <interfacing_methods>` to
convert to common network representations and graph objects of popular Python
network packages.

**Disclaimer**

Since this project is fairly new, it's not unlikely you might encounter some
bugs here and there. Although the core functionalities are covered pretty well
by test scripts, particularly the plotting methods could use some more testing.

Furthermore, at this point, you can expect rather frequent updates to the
package as well as the documentation. So please make sure to check for updates
every once in a while.

So far the package has only been developed by me, a fact that I would like
to change very much. So if you feel like contributing in any way, shape or
form, please feel free to contact me, report bugs, create pull requestes,
milestones, etc. You can contact me via email: dominik.traxl@posteo.org
